Cases and deaths data are assigned to dates based on when figures are publicly reported. For case and death seven-day averages, if there are days within that range with no data reported, the period is extended to older days until at least seven days of data are included. Data from days following non-reporting days is averaged over that day and the non-reporting days that precede it. When calculating rolling averages, these days representing multiple day's worth of data are always included together, which means that in instances of irregularly timed reporting, the seven-day average may be an average over more than seven days. Certain days with anomalous total case or death reports are excluded from the average or have a portion of their cases and deaths which correspond to data backlogs removed from the average calculation. For the U.S. national case and death count averages, the average is the sum of the average number of cases and deaths in all states and territories each day.
